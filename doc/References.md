* **Documentation and Help about KeyNote NF**:  
  Currently there is not an updated nor completed document or page that includes all the
  functionality of KeyNote NF. The Help file corresponds to version 1.6.5 and is also
  incomplete.
  Anyway, you can find information relative to funcionality specific to 1.6.5 (the majority) and 
  next versions in the following resources:

     * **Keynote.chm**

     * **sample.knt**  
       This file is opened automatically when you start KeyNote for the first time. It contains many tips,
       features, keyboard shortcuts, and showcases some of KeyNote's capabilities (only to 1.6.5 version, by now)
       DO NOT USE THIS FILE FOR PERSONAL NOTES! It will be overwritten when you upgrade Keynote to a new version.
  
     * **KN_Handbook.knt**  
      This file is a compilation of many information related to KeyNote, prepared by Marek: 
      _"This file was created of my need to keep all the KeyNote related files at one spot."_
   
     * **history.txt**  
       File that contains detailed information about all KeyNote features added (and bugs corrected) since the 
       program was first released.
       Since version 1.7.4 each entry is classified as 'Enhancements' or 'Bugfixes', and referenced with 
       an issue number.
       With that number it is possible to get more information about the issue, now in
       [GitHub - issues](https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues)  
       For example, version 1.7.6 included new feature, referenced by issue 57:  
           * _Issue #57: New kind of virtual nodes: links to other nodes (Mirror nodes)_  
       Accesible now via the following URL in GitHub: <https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/57>   
  
     * **Issues**  
       Is is possible to look for issues of certain label to find bugs resolved or new features.
       For example, look for new features or enhacements:
